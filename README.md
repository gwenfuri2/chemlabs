## 🔍 Project Features

| Simulation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🧪 Acid-Base Titration | pH vs Volume curve with live Chart.js graph and indicator color feedback |
| ❄️ Freezing Point Depression | Calculates ΔTf based on user input, explores colligative properties |
| 🔥 Heat of Fusion | Step-by-step calorimetry simulator with animated thermometer and ice |
| ⚡ Reaction Rates | Basic rate = Δ[Reactant]/Δt calculator for intro kinetics |
| 💊 Aspirin Synthesis (OChem 1) | Full organic synthesis simulation with procedure, reaction diagram, color test, animated crystallization, and yield plots |

## 🧠 Educational Goals

Students can:

- Simulate experiments they’d normally conduct in lab
- Learn chemical principles interactively
- Practice calculations like molality, energy changes, reaction rates, and yields
- Visualize molecular reactions (e.g. esterification)
- Interpret test results like the FeCl₃ color reaction

---

## 🧪 Highlight: Aspirin Synthesis Module

- Step-by-step synthesis walkthrough (OChem 1 level)
- Yield visualization chart (actual vs theoretical)
- Ferric chloride test simulator (color feedback)
- Crystallization animation
- Reaction mechanism diagram
- Educational explanations for every step

---

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- HTML5 + CSS3 (mobile-responsive)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Chart.js (for graphs)
- Modular layout per page
- Hosted via GitHub Pages
